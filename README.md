# unified-support
Import/export formats for bibliographic tools to add support of the [Unified Style Sheet](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/unified-style-sheet):
- [jabref](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref) (export BibTeX entries as plain text in Unified Style)
- [papercite](https://github.com/bpiwowar/papercite) (display BibTeX entries in Unified Style)

A CSL style definition can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles/unified-style-linguistics). 
For an implementation in BibLaTeX, have a look at [biblatex-sp-unified](https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified).
